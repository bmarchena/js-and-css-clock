## css-js-clock ##

This is an analog clock web application built using HTML/CSS and JavaScript. The app takes the current time and uses it to manipulate the three individual hands in order to display the current time in an analog format. The hands are animated tick realistically, bouncing slightly into place as a real clock would.
